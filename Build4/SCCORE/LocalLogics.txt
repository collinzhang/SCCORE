// User's project specific logic models for small logic elements,similar to those found in C:\Flynn Systems Corp\onTAP\Logics.txt file, may be placed here.
// onTAP can rewrite Logics.txt when updating onTAP so LocalLogics.txt is intended to prevent user logic models from being overwritten during updates if the user places models in Logics.txt.
// Logic models sent to support@flynn.com will be checked and added to Logics.txt for safe updates and general use
// Projects must be restarted after changing the LocalLogics.txt or Logics.txt files.
