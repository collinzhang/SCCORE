 The Pin Test Report is best viewed in an editor, such as TextPad, that can split the screen
 both horizontally and vertically.
 Using the splitter controls, fix the net and pin names on the left side of the
 screen and the vector numbers at the top of the screen. 
 Using the scroll controls, pin values appear in a spreadsheet format from vector to vector.
 0's and 1's indicate values driven from pins.
 L's and H's indicate values expected to be captured by pins.
 ^'s identify failing pins if a test has been run.
 Errors may indicate conflicting values driven onto a net in one vector.
